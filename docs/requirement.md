# üß© Front-end Requirements - Lumbung Mesari

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the front-end requirements for the **Lumbung Mesari** savings and loans cooperative system. The front-end is built using **Nuxt 3**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Volt UI**, and interacts with a RESTful API backend developed using NestJS. The goal is to deliver an MVP that focuses on core features such as user authentication, member management, savings tracking, and loan processing.

## 5. Component Guidelines

- Use Volt UI components where available
    
- Style with Tailwind CSS for consistency
    
- Recommended reusable components:
    
    - `BaseCard.vue`
        
    - `FormField.vue`
        
    - `StatusBadge.vue`
        
    - `ToastNotification.vue`
        
    - `LoanCalculator.vue`
        

---

## 6. API Integration

- Use Axios instance with JWT header
    
- Implement route protection via auth middleware
    
- Suggested API composables:
    
    ```
    /composables/useAuth.ts
    /composables/useSavings.ts
    /composables/useLoans.ts
    ```
    

### Example Endpoints (assumed from backend spec)

- `POST /auth/login`
    
- `GET /me`
    
- `POST /register`
    
- `GET /savings`
    
- `POST /loans`
    
- `GET /admin/members`
    
- `POST /admin/approve-loan`
    

---

## 7. Authentication & Session Flow

- Login generates JWT token (stored in cookie/localStorage)
    
- Manual 2FA verification via email
    
- Protected routes use middleware (`auth.ts`)
    
- Logout clears session and redirects to login
    

---

## 8. Feature Prioritization

### ‚úÖ Phase 1 - MVP

- Authentication (login, register, 2FA)
    
- Member dashboard
    
- Savings (without Midtrans integration)
    
- Loan application form
    
- Admin member and loan approval
    

### ‚è≥ Phase 2 - Optional

- Midtrans integration
    
- Monthly PDF reports
    
- Transaction history download
    
- Email notification visuals

## 9. AI Agent Notes

- Preferred file formats: `.vue`, `.ts`, `.md`
    
- Pages use `default.vue` layout, except auth uses `auth.vue`
    
- Use responsive and modular components
    
- Prefer Volt UI and Tailwind for design consistency
    
- Use mock data only if API is not ready
